# CS 326, Operating Systems

### These are the projects from my operating systems class.

The projects found here are in two folders, one called 'HW' and the other 'Programs'.
- The 'HW' folder contains the homework projects assigned.
- The 'Programs' folder will contain the programs assigned.  They are a task scheduler and a device driver.
