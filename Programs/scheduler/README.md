#### This program is a simulation of a UNIX scheduler.  It is written with the C programming language.

The compiler used is gcc and the compilation instruction used was this command:
  ```$gcc -Wall -ansi -o scheduler.exe scheduler.c -lm```
  
  The program can be run within the Linux terminal with this command:
  ```./scheduler.exe```
  
 Thank you for looking at my work!
